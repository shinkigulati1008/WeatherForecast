# Weather Finder App

Welcome to the Weather Finder App, a React-based application designed to provide users with real-time weather information and a visually appealing background animation. This project showcases the integration of the OpenWeather API for fetching weather data and Three.js for creating interactive 3D animations, including a rotatable Earth background.

# Features
Weather Information: Utilizes the OpenWeather API to display current weather conditions for a user-selected city. Users can search for a city, and the app will fetch and display the weather data, including temperature, weather conditions, and an icon representing the current weather.
Interactive 3D Background: Employs Three.js to create a rotatable Earth background animation. This feature adds a dynamic and engaging visual element to the app, enhancing the user experience by providing a visually appealing backdrop to the weather information.
